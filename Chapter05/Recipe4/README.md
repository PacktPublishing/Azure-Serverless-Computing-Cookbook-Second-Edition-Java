# Recipe 4
We have been creating and testing code locally the whole time in the Visual Studio Code IDE.  No new Java code is needed here.  If you want to test the commandline tools, just use a simple Http Trigger and test that using the guidence given.
You can test your existing functions code locally using "func host start --build".
A key thing missing in the book text, is updating the  local.settings.json file to provide application settings and so on.
